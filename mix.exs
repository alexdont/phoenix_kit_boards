      # shipped in core 1.7.189, and neither is guarded. `~> 1.7` admits
      # 1.7.0, which resolves a core with no such module: a compile error in
      # the consumer's build, not a degraded feature. (`PhoenixKit.Module`
      # needs 1.7.46, `PubSubHelper` 1.7.28, `Dashboard.Tab` 1.7.21 — all
      # covered by the same floor.)

      # The infinite-canvas engine + annotation layer. The host already loads
      # their JS + hooks (the media annotation feature), so these constraints
      # exist to agree with PhoenixKit core rather than to pull anything new.
      #
      # Both are deliberately tighter than core's, because this module calls
      # things core never does and an older release would degrade rather than
      # fail — which is the worst shape for a missing dependency to take.
      # Narrower is still compatible: a two-part `~>` runs to the next major,
      # so core admits everything this asks for.
      #
      # fresco 0.11: `setGridVisible` (the background-dots preference), and
      # the exemption that stops the canvas cancelling `dragstart` over an
      # overlay — without it the toolbar's customise dialog cannot be dragged.
      #
      # etcher 0.11: `onShapesMoving` / `applyShapesMoving`, which is how a
      # peer's drag is visible while it happens rather than only once they let
      # go, and `toolBadge`, which is how a cursor shows what its owner is
      # holding. All three are called through `typeof` guards, so an older
      # etcher loses live drags and tool cursors silently — hence pinning
      # rather than relying on the guard. 0.12 is additive on those APIs; the
      # lock tracks it, the constraint does not need to move.
      #
      # fresco 0.13.1 is the floor for two fingers. A board stamps
      # `data-fresco-no-capture` on the drawing overlay, and until 0.13.1 the
      # viewer took that to mean it should ignore the finger entirely — so a
      # second finger had nothing to pinch against and fed the stroke
      # instead, which on a phone is a line whipping between two fingers.
      # Written as a `>=` rather than `~> 0.13`, which would admit 0.13.0 and
      # lose it silently.
      #
      # etcher 0.18 is the floor for live drawing: `onDrawing`,
      # `applyDrawing` and `applyDrawingEnd`, which is how a peer watches a
      # stroke appear rather than waiting out the length of it. Guarded by
      # `typeof` like the drag APIs above, and pinned for the same reason —
      # an older etcher loses it without saying so.
