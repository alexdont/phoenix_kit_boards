defmodule PhoenixKitBoards.Web.BoardLive do
  @moduledoc """
  A single collaborative board (`/admin/boards/:id`).

  Renders a `<Fresco.canvas>` (infinite) + `<Etcher.layer>` and wires three
  real-time channels over one PubSub topic (`phoenix_kit_boards:<id>`):

    * **Shapes** — the client emits `etcher:annotations-changed` (full list) on
      every edit; we diff, persist, and broadcast. Peers diff against their own
      state and push a create/update/delete delta to `BoardSync`, which applies
      it via `window.Etcher.layerFor(id)` — no canvas remount. Echo is broken
      server-side (an unchanged list diffs to empty).
    * **Presence** — a roster of who's viewing, via join/hello/leave messages.
    * **Cursors** — pointer positions in *canvas* coordinates, so each viewer
      maps them through their own pan/zoom (`BoardCursors`).

  # Pasted / dropped images go to storage; the shape keeps a URL.
  #
  # Left alone, Etcher embeds an image file in the shape as a base64 data URL.
  # Since the whole annotation list is re-emitted on every edit, an embedded
  # screenshot is then re-sent in full every time anything on the board
  # changes — moving a shape, typing a label. Two or three images is enough to
  # push an ordinary edit past the socket's frame limit, and past it the socket
  # closes and the edit is lost with nothing shown to the user. Uploading costs
  # one request and keeps the list small however many images a board collects.
  # MIME types as well as extensions: a file off the clipboard is not
  # guaranteed to arrive with a usable filename, but it always carries a type.

  # page down with an ArgumentError at mount rather than degrading.
  #
  # So the list is filtered rather than trusted, applying LiveView's own two
  # rules (`Phoenix.LiveView.UploadConfig`): an extension needs a known type,

  # The client says when it can hear us, and only then is anything pushed.
  #
  # A `push_event` in the connected mount rides the join reply and is
  # dispatched the instant it lands. That was fine while hooks were registered
  # on the host's LiveSocket at construction time — `mounted` had already run.
  # Under this module's own runtime-hook delivery it is a race that is always
  # lost: the shim's `mounted` starts a ~40 KB fetch and the REAL
  # `BoardSync.mounted` — where `handleEvent("board:channel")` is registered —
  # runs hundreds of milliseconds later. The events dispatch to nobody and are
  # gone.
  #
  # The visible result was a board that rendered, edited and saved, while live
  # cursors, in-flight drags and stored preferences never appeared — because
  # the channel token and the prefs both arrived before anything was listening.
  # A host log showed 12 successful bundle fetches and zero BoardSocket
  # connections.
  #
  # So the hooks announce themselves and this answers. Correct under both
  # delivery models — a host-registered hook simply sends the ping a few
  # milliseconds earlier — and any push added here later inherits the same
  # guarantee. The extra round trip is dwarfed by the fetch it replaces
  # racing.
  #
  # Answered on EVERY ping rather than once. Both hooks ping, and whichever
  # mounts last triggers a push that both are registered for by then; the

      A finger on this page is drawing, panning or pressing a control — never
      selecting text. The canvas itself has said so since Fresco 0.5
      (`user-select: none`), but it does not fill the page: there is a header
      above it and a gutter either side, ~17px wide on a 390px screen. A drag
      that starts a few pixels off the canvas is a text drag, and it takes the
      page with it — which is the "it selected everything" that comes and goes
      depending on where the finger landed.

      `pointer-coarse` so this costs a mouse nothing: selecting the board's
      title or a name from the roster still works with a cursor. On iOS the
      callout has to be named separately — a long press raises it through
      `user-select: none`.

      <%!-- The upload target for pasted / dropped images. Never shown and
            never clicked — `BoardSync` feeds it files through `this.upload/2`
            — but LiveView finds an upload by locating its input in the DOM,
            so it has to be here. Outside #board-root, which is
            phx-update="ignore" and therefore off-limits to LiveView.

            The form is load-bearing, not decoration: `this.upload/2` tracks
            the files and then dispatches a bubbling `input` event, and a
            form's `phx-change` is what carries that to the server. Without
            one the event bubbles into nothing, the server is never told an
            entry exists, and the upload silently never happens. --%>
