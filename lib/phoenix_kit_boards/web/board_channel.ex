defmodule PhoenixKitBoards.Web.BoardChannel do
  @moduledoc """
  Relays a board's ephemeral traffic between the people looking at it.

  Three kinds, all worthless a moment after they arrive:

    * `"cursor"` — where someone's pointer is, in canvas coordinates, so each
      viewer maps it through their own pan and zoom.
    * `"moving"` — where a shape is *while it is still being dragged*. Peers
      patch it into place and see the drag happen; the edit itself is stored
      and broadcast the usual way when the gesture ends.
    * `"drawing"` — the shape somebody is *still drawing*, before it exists.
      It has no uuid yet, so the draft travels whole (kind, geometry, style)
      and peers key it by the sender: one person draws one shape at a time.
      The finished shape arrives as an ordinary edit, which is what a reload
      would show.

  Deliberately does nothing else. No database, no diff, no persistence, and
  no state beyond who is on the topic — the point of moving this off the
  LiveView was to stop this traffic queueing behind that work.

  The sender is excluded from everything it sends (`broadcast_from`): it drew
  its own cursor and moved its own shape locally, and echoing would fight the
  gesture in progress.

  Nothing arriving here is trusted as identity. The peer is whatever the
  signed join token said, so a client can move its own cursor and nobody
  else's.
