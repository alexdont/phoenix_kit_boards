defmodule PhoenixKitBoards.StaleListTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A board edit is sent as the whole board, and that is how work gets lost.

  Reported from a phone: drawing on the phone was replicating to a desktop
  live and well, and then — after letting go and starting something on the
  desktop — "one of the letters I was writing disappeared, I had to redraw
  it".

  Nothing deleted it. Etcher pushes the complete annotation list on every
  change, so a shape's ABSENCE from that list is how a delete is expressed.
  It is also exactly what a list composed a moment before somebody else's
  shape arrived looks like. The phone's socket had stalled; when it came back
  its list went out as it was, without the letter the desktop had drawn in the
  meantime, and `diff/2` read the gap as a deletion and told everybody.

  From the list alone the two are indistinguishable, so they are told apart by
  AGE. A shape this board heard about a second ago cannot have been on the
  sender's screen when they built their payload: their silence is ignorance,
  and the shape is put back before the comparison. One the board has held for
  half a minute, they had and dropped: that is a delete, and it stands.

  The window costs the opposite case — deleting a peer's brand-new shape
  inside it puts the shape back, and you delete it again. Work that cannot be
  recovered is the worse of the two losses. It never touches your own shapes,
  which do not arrive from a peer, so drawing something and undoing it
  straight away is unaffected.
